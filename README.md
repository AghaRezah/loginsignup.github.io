## Usage
To use this PHP file, you will need to have a local development environment set up on your computer. 
The term "localhost" refers to the local server environment on your machine.

## What is localhost?
"Localhost" is a hostname commonly used to refer to the current device or the local server environment. 
When you access a website or run a web application on your computer, it utilizes the local server, which is referred to as "localhost".

In the context of this PHP file, running it on localhost means executing the file on your local server environment.
This allows you to test and develop your PHP code locally without the need for a live internet connection or deploying it to a remote server.

## Setting Up Localhost
To set up a local server environment, you can use software like XAMPP. 
XAMPP is a popular, cross-platform web server solution that provides all the necessary components for creating a local development environment. 
It includes Apache (web server), MySQL (database), PHP, and Perl.

Here are the steps to set up XAMPP:
   + Download XAMPP from the official website: https://www.apachefriends.org/index.html
   + Install XAMPP on your computer by following the installation instructions provided for your operating system.
   + Once the installation is complete, start the XAMPP control panel.
   + Start the Apache and MySQL services from the control panel.
   + Copy the PHP file to the appropriate directory in the XAMPP installation (e.g., the htdocs folder).
   + Open your web browser and visit http://localhost/ [file name] to run the PHP file.

## Importing the Database

If your PHP file requires a database, you may need to import the database into your local server environment. To import a database, follow these steps:

   + Open the XAMPP control panel and ensure that the MySQL service is running.
   + Launch your web browser and visit http://localhost/phpmyadmin.
   + In the phpMyAdmin interface, select the "Import" tab from the top navigation menu.
   + Click on the "Choose File" button and browse to the location of our database file ( a .sql file).
   + Select the database file in database folder in our directory.
   + Click the "Go" button to start the import process.
   + Wait for the import to complete. Once finished, you will see a success message indicating that the database has been imported.
